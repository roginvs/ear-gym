## TODO
- [ ] Increase piano volume or add own predictable compressor implementation
- [ ] Other games: 3 button (A, both, B): distortion, reverb?, saturator, compressor
- [ ] Other games: delay
- [ ] Remove or change saturation game due to unequalized samples volume
- [ ] Volume game: think about tasks. +3/-3 is not the same as -12/-6
- [ ] Show level info, like eq width and eq gain
- [ ] Reduce stage amount, 20 is quite annoying
- [ ] Icons for musicTypes
- [ ] Update React (or add polyfill), use getDerivedStateFromProps instead of key-binding to component instance
- [ ] Add some build timestamp (via webpack plugin or similar)
- [x] Possibility to hear sound with and without fx after answer
- [x] Gain game
- [x] Refactor gameRenders
- [x] Simplify challenge at low levels
- [x] possibility to start game at last achieved level
- [x] tothink: to clear lives on level start?
